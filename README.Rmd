This package provides useful functions to orchestrate analytics and data cleaning pipelines for One Health projects.  

## Installation

You can install the development version of ohcleandat from [GitHub](https://github.com/one-health-research-consulting/ohcleandat) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("one-health-research-consulting/ohcleandat")
```
 
## Getting Started   

For help guides, check out the package vignettes.   

## Contributions  

This project uses the [Gitflow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow). 

All new feature requests should be done in a new branch based on `dev` or a fork of `dev`. New branches can take the form `feature/*` or `fix/*`. Once the feature is complete, automated CI checks and merge checks will be performed and a pull request should be raised to merge changes into `dev`.  

Once the package is nearing a release, a `release/x.x.x` branch should be created from the head of `dev`. This is used to make any changes to convert the code to production level and to increment the version number and make release notes if required before raising a PR into `main`. Once the PR into `main` is accepted, a github release should be performed, using the package version
as the tag. 

A final step is deleting any feature and release branches and merging `main` back into `dev` and
incrementing the `dev` version to `x.x.x.9000`.
