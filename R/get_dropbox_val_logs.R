#' Get Dropbox Validation Logs
#'
#' Downloads existing validation logs that are stored on dropbox
#'
#' This function will check if the log exists and return NULL if not. Else it will
#' locally download the file to 'dropbox_validations' directory and read in to the
#' session.
#'
#' @param file_name character file name with extension of the validation log.
#' Note that file may have been zipped on upload if its over 300mb. This file
#' will be automatically unzipped on download so provide the file extenstion for
#'  the compressed file, not the zipped file. E.g. "val_log.csv" even if on
#'  dropbox its stored as "val_log.zip".
#' @param folder character the folder the log is saved in on drop box. Can be NULL if not in subfolder.
#' @param path_name character the default drop box path
#'
#' @return tibble a Validation Log
